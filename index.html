      <p>Zbigniew Herbert was one of the most celebrated Polish poets and essayists in Poland and abroad. Born in the then-Polish city of Lwow in 1924, he rose to prominence after 1956 for his works offering an intimate gaze into the realities of post-war life in Poland and elsewhere. Herbert often addressed the suffering and strife of war itself. Above all else, Herbert was a poet who felt morally compelled to &ldquo;give testimony,&rdquo; as he writes in one of his most well-known works, <em>The Enovy of Mr. Cogito:</em></p>

      <h3>you were saved not in order to live<br>
      you have little time you must give testimony</h3>
      
      <p>The poem ends thusly:</p>
      
      <h3>go because only in this way will you be admitted to the company of cold skulls<br>
      to the company of your ancestors: Gilgamesh Hector Roland<br>
      the defenders of the kingdom without limit and the city of ashes</h3>
      <h3>Be faithful Go</h3>
      
      <p>Herbert's deliberate lack of punctation speaks to an ongoing story &ndash; the one of humankind. This is a story that is still being told, our hours and days slipping away into the realm of history; what was once a distant futurity approaching more rapidly than ever. Herbert seemed hyperaware of his place in history: as a poet destined to serve as a sort of moral compass, to write extensively about the city where he was born, which is never named, even in <em>Mr. Cogito Considers a Return to His Native Town:</em></p>
      
      <h3>If I went back there<br>
      I would probably not find <br>
      a single shadow of my old home</h3>
            
      <h3>all that survived <br>
      is a flagstone<br>
      with a chalk circle<br>
      I stand in the middle<br>
      on one leg<br>
      the moment before jumping</h3>
      
      <h3>I cannot grow up<br>
      though years pass<br>
      and planets and wars<br>
      clamor overhead</h3>
      
      <p>Herbert passed at the age of 73 in Warsaw. During his time on this earth, he travelled extensively &ndash; but he always returned to Poland, though he remained very much trapped in that liminal space between exile and return.</p>
      
      <p>The geopolitical consequences of war are well-documented: Herbert gave a much more personal testimony on the human cost of war.</p>
      
      <p>In Mr. Cogito Reads the Newspaper, Herbert writes of his persona:</p>
      
      <h3>for 120 dead <br>
      you search on a map in vain</h3>
      
      <h3>too great a distance <br>
      covers them like a jungle</h3>
      
      <h3>they don't speak to the imagination <br>
      there are too many of them <br>
      the numeral zero at the end <br>
      changes them into an abstraction.</h3>
      
      <p>His work remains relevant today, ever more so in light of the ongoing Russian military attack on Ukraine. <br>
